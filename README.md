Hypixel-Skyblock
================

My own interpretation of the Skyblock Minigame from Hypixel.net.



Expectation
-----------
This network should bring every feature like hypixel does. Maybe this gonna be a selfhosted network at some point. obviously free to play and without ranks.

Developer 
---------

This "plugin" is divided into modules in IntelliJ IDEA. Those Modules works independent from each other. The only exception is the core module, this module is needed from almost every module in this project.

Modules

Just the groundstone of this system.
